# AI-X-risk-cheat-sheet

This is mostly just to provide a more serious link than a Google Sheet document for the cheat sheet. Go read the post (first link below) instead of looking at this clunky thing.

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yY49FWXfgY7x4l9DXg1dh4X-wlp5kT8YVaP0JRrxxhA/edit for an explanation/analysis of the sheet.

See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JrFVI2jEM1-qd2Wlrv6BFikp4p9Aj70wEhrMFoxwfCI/edit#gid=1276620262 for the sheet itself.

See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u-oNMTE66DwIRuKaLsqHJ8qzFoYu7Y1aCGU3spqahUQ/edit#gid=1276620262 for a detailed version (not up-to-date).
